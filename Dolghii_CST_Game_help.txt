Implementation Details / How to build the program - Make sure all the neccessary
files are in the same folder/location as the program. Make sure you have easyGUI
0.97 or later installed as well. Once that is made sure, start the program. 
There is a help menu for information on how to play (which is strongly 
recommended). After that, start the game. Click on your choice and the 
program will decide if you have won against your opponent. If there is a draw, 
you play for the same point again. Most importantly, have fun!
